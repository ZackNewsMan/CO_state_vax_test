The I used Adobe's Excel conversion software to turn each PDF into an Excel. I got the Department of Personnel Administration to send me updated data every Friday. The folder "DPA state vax data" has all of those PDF's in there. 

The calculations weren't that complicated and I was able to reformat the data with the "transpose" option within the paste function of Excel.

"StatewideEmployeeVaxStats_100821-120321" has the calculations over time. It is uploaded here and also lives as a Google Sheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NqqQWvMFXSayBcttp1eKgYlJrprZu-qZ/edit#gid=2147433073
